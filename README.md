- 👋 Hi, I’m Hinrich
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and the techonologies that surrounds it. I'm also interested in pursuing gamedev in the future, but only if I have some spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced javascript, React, and maybe Next.js or Node in the future. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any webdev stuff as long as I think I can contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me: johnhinrichggalindo@gmail.com
